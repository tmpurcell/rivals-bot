* These are based on stats as well as personal experience. If you disagree, please explain why or what you think makes a character a better counter or a bad counter. If you see an asterisk it means it depends on the player skill and capability of the team as a whole, if it isn't an asterisk that means the character should relatively directly counter off kit alone.
* * Also Side Note, in many circumstances any character can counter any character this is just a comprehensive list of my gathered game knowledge that could help us in the future should it be needed.
* * Also Also, I find it redundant to put down every healer with a you cant kill us ult as a counter for every dps, so just assume Luna Snow Diffs and move on.
