This is a discord bot for the videogame Marvel Rivals.

This bot allows players to create a running list of all the characters that they play in each subset (DPS, tank, Support).
Each player ID from discord connects to a mongoDB that stores the information and can be updated as the player improves.


The bot contains a command list that is accessable with /commands so that all available commands are accessable and laid out for the player.

This bot can be hosted locally through nodemon or hosted on a site. I am currently hosting the bot on a raspberry pi.

Further updates are still in the works!
